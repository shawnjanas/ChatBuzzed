**ChatBuzzed**

Chatbuzzed was a two-way video conferencing platform restricted for McMaster University students where two random students are selected to engage in a chatting environment using their webcam and microphone.

This startup was launched in March 2010 and I have decided to open source the code. I misplaced the .flv files for the Client and ClientLoader file but it was just the interface code. 

The com directory contains the library for developing the chatting environment in ActionScript3 and the FlashMediaSever is server side ActionScript3 for handling concurrent connections and a roulette style algorithm to match users to engage in a video conversation.
